# 🚀 Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Using Historical Data

## 📊 Overview

The main purpose of this project, **"Predicting Cryptocurrency Price Movements by Using Historical Data"**, is to predict and foresee the behavior of specific cryptocurrencies in the near future by leveraging their historical data. This project establishes a connection between the rapidly evolving fields of **Finance** and **Machine Learning**, contributing to the understanding of market trends and supporting informed decision-making.

The project utilizes **Machine Learning techniques**, specifically **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Regressor**, to forecast daily cryptocurrency prices and analyze their trends. By integrating historical data, key financial indicators, and advanced modeling techniques, the project aims to provide a robust and interpretable prediction framework.

## ✨ Features and Objectives

### 🎯 Key Features

1. **Technical Indicator - RSI Calculation**:
   * The **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**, a momentum-based technical indicator, is calculated to measure market conditions (e.g., overbought or oversold).

2. **Data Preprocessing and Normalization**:
   * Historical data is normalized using **MinMaxScaler** to scale features like closing price, trading volume, and RSI values between 0 and 1, improving model convergence.
   * A **sliding window approach** is implemented to generate lag-based feature sets for time-series prediction.

3. **Prediction and Visualization**:
   * Historical predictions are compared to actual values to evaluate model accuracy.
   * Future price predictions are visualized for selected cryptocurrencies.
   * Bar charts highlight prediction accuracy across training, testing, and future datasets.
   * Percentage change analysis compares historical and predicted trends.

4. **Dynamic Financial Data Retrieval**:
   * Data is fetched from **Yahoo Finance API** for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), and ApeCoin (APE).

### 🎯 Objectives

* Predict cryptocurrency price movements with high accuracy using historical data.
* Assist investors in managing risks, identifying profit opportunities, and preparing for market uncertainties.
* Explore the intersection of **Machine Learning** and **Financial Technologies** to enhance cryptocurrency analysis.

## 🔍 Methodology

### 📥 Data Collection

* Historical data is collected from Yahoo Finance for four cryptocurrencies:
  * **Bitcoin (BTC)**, **Dogecoin (DOGE)**, **Solana (SOL)**, and **ApeCoin (APE)**.
* Features include:
  * **Closing Price**: Reflects market trends and sentiment.
  * **Volume**: Represents market activity and liquidity.
  * **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Indicates momentum by identifying overbought/oversold conditions.
* Data from the past 8 years is utilized, split into **80% training** and **20% testing** subsets using `train_test_split`.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

The following Python libraries and tools were used:

* **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis (loading, cleaning, and transforming cryptocurrency data).
* **NumPy**: Numerical computations for feature preparation, percentage change calculations, and array operations.
* **Matplotlib**: Visualization of results, including actual vs. predicted prices and accuracy comparisons.
* **scikit-learn**:
  * `MinMaxScaler` for feature normalization.
  * `train_test_split` for data splitting.
  * `MLPRegressor` for time-series prediction.
  * Evaluation metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R².
* **yfinance**: Retrieval of historical financial data (e.g., daily closing prices, trading volumes).

## ⚠️ Limitations and Future Work

### Limitations

1. External market factors like regulatory changes or societal events are not accounted for, which can lead to deviations in forecasts.
2. Predictions are sensitive to the chosen look-back period and feature set.
3. Only a limited set of technical indicators (Close, Volume, RSI) is used.

### 🔮 Future Improvements

1. Incorporate additional technical indicators like moving averages (e.g., SMA, EMA) and **MACD** for enhanced predictions.
2. Perform sentiment analysis using social media data to capture public perception and its impact on cryptocurrency prices.
3. Utilize **Deep Learning models** (e.g., LSTM, GRU) for improved time-series forecasting.
